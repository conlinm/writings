Note: discussion with Kopp
Compare measures of quality and practice pattern variation:
1. extent of LN dissection
2. Margin positive
3. utilization of adjuvant therapies in appropriate settings
  - hormonal therapy for node positive
  - radiotherapy for positive margins
  - hormonal therapy for radiation for high risk disease

Data quality of EMR abstraction (AQUA) vs. data registry (NCDB)
- missing staging data
- missing data in general
- incorrect data
- data integrity

2. Title: Measures of Radical Prostatectomy Oncologic Quality of Care Across Three Databases: Practice Patterns, Outcomes, and Comparison of Data Collection Methodologies.

a. Aims:
1. Determine the differences in oncologic quality measures (extent of lymph node dissection, rates of positive margins, and appropriate use of adjuvant therapies) for men undergoing radical prostatectomy.
2. Examine possible predictors of these quality measures such as preoperative prostate cancer stage and grade, patient demographics, and comorbidities.
3. Determine the effects of these quality measures on overall and cancer-specific survival.
4. Determine practice pattern variations in these measures and potential predictors of inconsistent, poor, and exceptional outcomes.
5. Compare the incidence of missing or incorrect prostate cancer related data between the National Cancer Database (NCDB), Survivor, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER), and AUA Quality Registry (AQUA).

b. Impact:
Quality of radical prostatectomy can have an enormous effect on patient outcomes. Our initial investigation of lymph node dissection at the time of radical prostatectomy using the NCDB, suggests there is significant variation and opportunities for improving the quality of our oncologic care of these men. By determining these oncologic quality measures, and what factors might effect them, we hope to discover specific areas where focused improvement efforts might best improve the quality of care for this population. Comparing the data quality across these three databases can help the development of future data acquisition methods and may facilitate future prostate cancer research.

c. Approach:
We are interested in studying measures of oncologic quality for radical prostatectomy, including extent of lymph node dissection, rates of margin positivity, and appropriate utilization of adjuvant therapies. We have experience measuring these factors using data from the NCDB. We hope to expand our study to include data from SEER and AQUA. This will allow us to better determine factors that might influence practice pattern variations in these measures. We will extract the appropriate data from these data sets  to build univariate and multivariate regression models to determine possible predictors of quality. These models can then be used to produce predicted values and allow determination of possible lost opportunities for improved care, for instance positive nodes not found due to inadequate lymph node dissection.
We believe AQUA may represent a unique dataset, both because the participants involved are likely a more motivated group of surgeons, and the novel data extraction technique used to capture data. This will permit a comparison of a traditional "curated" database such as NCDB and SEER, with a more modern electronic health record (EHR) extracted dataset, using modern technologies such as natural language processing. We believe the later may represent an improved set of data, with less missing data and fewer data errors. This new method of data extraction and entry, computer-based rather than human-based data extraction and keyboard entry, has potential accuracy advantages. AQUA is one of the first of it's kind of data sources, in what is sure to be a growing field of EHR-based data 'extraction' databases. A direct comparison of these datasets and specific prostate cancer treatment measures and data quality is our secondary goal.  
d. Funding Requested: $25,000 will be used for research administrator and faculty salary support for data extraction, normalization, and statistical analysis.
