Note: discussion with Kopp
Compare measures of quality and practice pattern variation:
1. extent of LN dissection
2. Margin positive
3. utilization of adjuvant therapies in appropriate settings
  - hormonal therapy for node positive
  - radiotherapy for positive margins
  - hormonal therapy for radiation for high risk disease

Data quality of EMR abstraction (AQUA) vs. data registry (NCDB)
- missing staging data
- missing data in general
- incorrect data
- data integrity

2. Title: Measures of Surgical Quality of Radical Prostatectomy Across Three Databases: Practice Patterns, Outcomes, and Comparison of Data Collection Methodologies.

a. Aims:
1. Determine the differences in specific quality measures (extent of lymph node dissection, rates of positive margins, and appropriate use of adjuvant therapies) for men undergoing radical prostatectomy and factors that effect these measures.
2. Examine possible clinical predictors of these quality measures such as preoperative prostate cancer stage and grade, patient demographics, and comorbidities.
3. Determine the effects of these quality measures on overall and cancer-specific survival.
4. Determine practice pattern variations in these measures and potential predictors of inconsistent, poor, and exceptional outcomes.
5. Compare data quality between NCDB and AQUA with regard to these data needing to determine these quality measures, including missing data, and false or incorrect data.

b. Impact:

c. Approach:
We are interested in studying measures of quality for radical prostatectomy, including extent of lymph node dissection, rates of margin positivity, and appropriate utilization of adjuvant therapies. We have experience measuring these factors using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). We hope to extend our interest to include data from the AQUA registry. This will allow us to determine factors that might influence practice pattern variations in these measures. We believe the AQUA database may represent a unique dataset, both because the participants involved are likely a more motivated group of surgeons, and the novel data extraction technique used to capture data. This will permit a comparison of a traditional "curated" database such as NCDB, with a more modern extracted dataset, using modern technologies such as natural language processing. We believe the later may represent an improved set of data, with less missing data and fewer data errors. The different methods of data extraction and entry, when done in computerize fashion rather than utilizing a human based data extraction and keyboard entry, has potential advantages. The Aqua data registry is one of the first of it's kind of data sources, in what is sure to be a growing field of electronic medical record based data computerized data extraction. While these techniques have been validated, a direct comparison of datasets and specific prostate cancer treatment measure and data quality is our goal.
