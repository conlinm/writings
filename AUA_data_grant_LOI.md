We propose a study to determine the effect of extent of lymph node dissection at the time of radical prostatectomy on the detection of lymph node involvement with prostate cancer.
We wish to investigate the effect of detection of lymph node involvement with prostate cancer in men being treated for prostate cancer. Specifically, we will determine the effect of the extent of lymph node dissection on our ability to detect lymph node involvement. How many men with lymph node involvement are missed and what are the survival implications of this missed opportunity.
Aims:
1.  Determine the differences in the extent of lymph node dissection in men undergoing radical prostatectomy in the United States.
2. Determine factors that may influence extent of lymph node dissection, such as preoperative prostate cancer stage and grade, patient demographics, and comorbidities.
3. Determine the effects of extent of pelvic lymph node dissection on overall and cancer-specific survival
4. Compare these data across NCDB and SEER data


Note: discussion with Kopp
Compare measures of quality and practice pattern variation:
1. extent of LN dissection
2. Margin positive
3. utilization of adjuvant therapies in appropriate settings
  - hormonal therapy for node positive
  - radiotherapy for positive margins
  - hormonal therapy for radiation for high risk disease

Data quality of EMR abstraction (AQUA) vs. data registry (NCDB)
- missing staging data
- missing data in general
- incorrect data
- data integrity
